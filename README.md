## AI Powered Movie Recommendations

**MovieGPT** leverages the power of **Generative AI** in order to provide relevant movie recommendations based on user input.

In order to achieve that, it relies on the following components:

* **Open Source Data**: we rely on movie data provided by Wikipedia, such as: movie summaries, genres, actor names and so on. This data is converted to embeddings for further indexing in a **Vector Database**.
* **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: we use a **Vector Database** and **semantic search** in order to guarantee relevant results. This way, we limit the **context** that is provided to **large language models** when generating recommendations, hence reducing the risk of **hallucinations** in the process.
* **ChatGPT**: we use ChatGPT for formatting the responses with movie recommendations in a human-like fashion.
